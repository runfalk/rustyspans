# Rustyspans

Rustyspans is an implementation of PostgreSQL's range types in pure Rust. It
does not help with communicating with the database. It is based on the project
[Spans](https://github.com/runfalk/spans) for Python, but implemented in a
"rusty" way.


## Disclaimer

This library is mostly written as a learning excercise. Consider this
experimental alpha software and do not use it in production.
